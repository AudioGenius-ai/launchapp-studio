## Integration Status ✅

1. **TypeScript Configuration**: ✅ Added to main tsconfig.json references
2. **Path Mappings**: ✅ Added `@code-pilot/router` to tsconfig.base.json
3. **Package Dependencies**: ✅ Configured with react-router-dom
4. **Build System**: ✅ Successfully compiles to dist/

## Usage

```typescript
// Import the router
import { AppRouter, routes, AuthGuard } from '@code-pilot/router';

// Use in your app
function App() {
  return <AppRouter />;
}

// Access route configuration
import { routes, navigationRoutes } from '@code-pilot/router';

// Use navigation hook
import { useAppNavigation } from '@code-pilot/router';
```

## Features Included

- ✅ Route configuration with metadata (title, auth, layout, sidebar)
- ✅ AuthGuard component for route protection
- ✅ Multiple layout support (default, minimal, fullscreen)
- ✅ History management utilities
- ✅ Breadcrumb generation
- ✅ Navigation hook for programmatic routing
- ✅ Lazy loading support for route components
- ✅ Error boundaries for route errors
- ✅ TypeScript support with proper type definitions

## Notes

- The main AppRouter component is in JSX format for React compatibility
- All route components currently point to placeholder components
- Authentication is mocked (always returns true) for development
- Routes can be easily extended by updating src/routes/index.ts
- The package is ready for integration into the main application

## Next Steps

1. Update actual page components to replace placeholders
2. Implement real authentication logic in AuthGuard
3. Configure actual route paths for the application
4. Add any additional route guards or middleware as needed
